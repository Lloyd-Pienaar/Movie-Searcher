The _.put_ function revises or adds to existing information. The _.post_ function sends changes from the client to the server. The _.delete_ function deletes existing information. This program only makes use of the _.get_ function, as we only have the need to retrieve data.\n",

So a user should be able to get a piece of data or resource when linked to a specific URL. Each URL needs to be requested and the data received back is called a response. The _response = requests.get(url)_ function is used to ask for and receive data.\n",

The raw data from the requested URL is now requested as basic text data that can be read by humans, with the _data = response.text_ function, but it is still unreadable by Python. The _json_data = json.loads(data)_ function formats the JSON text into data that Python can now read. \n",

    "### Retrospective \n",
    "\n",
    "The retrospective intends to reflect on the problems encountered during the development of the program and how the problems were solved. Furthermore what improvements could be made to the final program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problems and solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem encountered was, \"What an API is?\" and \"How to use an API?\". These two questions were the first challenge, and through reading lots of articles and multiple YouTube videos, my knowledge began to grow on how to implement the API. Through many examples and iterations, the implementation of the API began to work. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next problem was implementing the _request.exceptions_ function, to prevent unforeseen crashes and errors. This was solved through lots of Stack Overflow pages and trail and error. Eventually getting the block of code working and covering all the bases of potential server/connection issues, if they arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with json and the API and converting it into something that Python can handle was another problem encountered. Again this was solved through lots of Stack Overflow pages and trail and error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Writing and reading to and from a text file was another smaller challenge but was quickly fixed with help from the textbook, \"Python for Everybody, Exploring Data Using Python 3\". Also creating a text file on the user's computer was better than making the file beforehand and then trying to find it and read and write to it. This also means that the code is standalone and does not need to have an attached .txt file, with the _f = open(\"Stored_movies.txt\", \"a\")_. The \"_a_\" parameter also allowed to store all the previously searched movie and not just the most recent movie search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "The program went through numerous iterations and was constantly updated and rewritten throughout the past few weeks. Trying to find improvements and more efficient manners in which to implement different modules and blocks of code. A few improvements can still be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest problems, when you search for a movie, the program searches for the closest movie that corresponds to the users keyword(s) that they entered, and then selects the first option from OMDB and returns the details of that selected movie. However, if there are multiple movies with the same name, the program just returns the first result that OMDB displays. So the code is at the mercy of how OMDB orders their movies with the same name. I was unable to provide a solution to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I have doubts about the manner and the efficiency of how the API was implemented and is used. My knowledge around APIs still needs improvement, however in the end though I feel I do have a program that runs smoothly with no errors or crashes. Also, the use of Object-oriented programming was not used in the program, because I felt as though I did not know enough about the topic to implement it well. I did, however, find that I didn't need to use it as I found alternative ways to code my program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "I am grateful for the experience I've gained over the course of this project and it has differently improved my coding skills greatly. I've come along way and still along way to got before mastery of Python."
